# Longitudinal Sorting
If it took 15 minutes to get picked up, it didn’t matter how fast the rest of the route was — passengers wouldn’t consider that an acceptable route.
This meant that when considering pairing A and B together, there was some maximum distance they could be apart from each other

Sort all of the passengers in from west to east

# Detour calculate
Detours were simple and efficient to calculate — we would take the estimated time for each passenger to get to their destination without a 
match and compare that with the total time it would take them to get to their destination when matched. 
For an ABAB ordering this meant passenger A’s detour was ABA minus AA, and passenger B’s detour was BAB minus BB
